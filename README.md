# xlsx-tools
These Excel tools are meant to standardize and expedite repetitive work tasks! Easy to use and doesn't require users to learn a programming language. Identifying information has been redacted.

Using these tools:
1. "Sample ID Builder" is used to standardize sample IDs for easy conversion to SEND format.
2. "SEQUENCE BUILDER_168samples-2plates" uses the previously generated sample IDs (step 1). It automatically builds a 96-well plate map and a sequence for instrumental analysis.
3. "Autofill Cal-QC Result" takes the raw export from the instrument software and automatically populates result tables with calibrator/QC data.

Coming Soon!

* "SEQUENCE BUILDER" - Dynamic sequence building: Automatically bracket rows with QC samples based on the total number of samples
* "Autofill Cal-QC Result" - Autofill study samples: Automatic population of study sample data based on IDs and timepoints
